Cyberpunk themed 1v1 local multiplayer game

Menu:
    Two players ready-up by jacking into their decks
        Maybe an animation of plugging a cord into the side of a decker’s head

In game
    the deckers control avatars, street-samurai-styled ethereal humanoids
    They fight in the matrix
        A “Nidhogg”-like 2D-platformer space, with some open areas, and some tight corridors
    They have a number of functions they can execute
        move() - they can walk side to side
        jump() - they can jump
        dash() - burst of speed in the direction they are pointing, kills opponent on contact
            The longer you hold down the key, the farther you go
            Has recharge time
        corrupt() - leave a trap in the environment deadly to both players
            Each player limited to 3? 5? (based on size of environment)
        hide() - become invisible
        jump() and dash() are disabled, move() is half-speed, and dash() does not recharge while active
